# FLTK Installation
To build an FLTK project on UBUNTU 20.04.

Install FLTK and two additional packages:
$ sudo apt install fltk1.3-dev
$ sudo apt install libxft-dev
$ sudo apt install libxinerama-dev
After this, you can define an FLTK project, and build it without problems.
If you do not install the libxft-dev and libXinerama-dev packages, you will indeed get these error messages listed in question about missing libraries (-lXft, -lfontconfig, -lXinerama).
